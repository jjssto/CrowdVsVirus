This script allows to search twitter using the package 'GetOldTweets3'
and than tries to extract the URLs of the pictures that are part of
the tweets.

The module *pictures* makes currently use of the package *torrequest*,
which routes requests though the Tor network. This is done in order to
not get blocked by twitter. If you intent on applying this on a large
scale, this solution is not ideal.

In order for it to work, control port access needs to be enabled in
torrc. Please refer to the Tor manual for further information:
